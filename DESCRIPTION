Description: Fit Bayesian stochastic block models (SBMs) and multi-level stochastic block models (MLSBMs) using efficient Gibbs sampling implemented in 'Rcpp'. The models assume symmetric, non-reflexive graphs (no self-loops) with unweighted, binary edges. Data are input as a symmetric binary adjacency matrix (SBMs), or list of such matrices (MLSBMs).
